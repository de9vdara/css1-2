        <p id="p2">Did you know some animals and plants can glow in the dark? This cool trick is called bioluminescence. It happens when a special chemical reaction inside their bodies creates light. It’s like nature’s version of neon lights!</p>
        <p id="p3">Here's how it works:</p>
        <ol id="ordl2">
            <li>A molecule called luciferin mixes with oxygen.</li>
            <li>An enzyme called luciferase helps speed up the process.</li>
            <li>Voilà! A glow appears, but without heat – it’s called “cold light.”</li>
        </ol>

        <p id="p4">Where do we see it?</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Fireflies: They flash to talk to each other and attract mates</li>
            <li>Deep-sea fish: They use it to scare predators or lure prey.</li>
            <li>Fungi and plants: Some even glow to attract bugs or spread spores!</li>
        </ul>
